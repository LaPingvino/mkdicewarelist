This is a program to generate a diceware list. For more details, please see:
http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html

To use, supply a list of at least 6783 words on the standard input. You'll then get a diceware list based on these words, plus the words from the Diceware Kit, on the standard output.

To do: customise the matching regex, allow user not to use the Diceware Kit wordlist.
