This is a program to generate a Diceware list. For more details, please see:
http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html

Usage:
	./mkdicewarelist [-r regex] [-d 5d6] [-k] <wordlist >dicewarelist

where:
	-r specifies a regex for selecting words from the wordlist
		(the default is ^.*$ - ie, all words from the list pass automatically)
	-d specifies the number and type of dice, using standard dice notation
		(the default is 5d6, ie 5 six-sided dice)
		You can use d4, d6, d8 or d10; you can also leave off the number before
		or after the 'd' to get the default (ie, d8 -> 5d8; 4d -> 4d6)
	-k means that the Diceware Kit Word List will not be used

In other words; for a standard Diceware list, don't use any parameters. But if
you want a particular custom type of list for some reason, you can.

With the default settings, you'll need to supply a list of at least 6783 words
on the standard input, one word per line. Note that you don't need to pre-sort
this list, however you should ensure that it has no duplicates. If there are too
many words, then a random selection will be made; even though this uses your
computer's pseudo-random generator, which isn't cryptographically secure, this
is not an issue for generating the word list, as it doesn't actually matter if
the words in the list are predictable - after all, the result is publicly known.
